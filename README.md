### About Me

Data analyst based in Ottawa, ON currently working as a Data Annotator for Theia. I enjoy turning rich data into valuable insights for others and applying my technical skills in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau wherever possible. 

Below are some of the analysis projects I have worked on – accompanied with code, visualizations, and detailed reports showcasing my passion for turning real world data into meaningful stories and actionable insights.
