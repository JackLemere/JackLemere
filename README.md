# About Me
Data analyst based in Ottawa, ON currently working as a Data Annotator for Theia. I enjoy turning data into valuable insights for others and applying my technical skills wherever possible.

Below are some of the analysis projects I have worked on – accompanied with relevant code, visualizations, and detailed reports showcasing my passion for turning real world data into meaningful stories and actionable insights.

# Projects
### [BUBBLEWICKS SALES ANALYSIS](https://github.com/JackLemere/Bubblewicks-Etsy-Sales-Analysis)
**Overview:** Bubblewicks is a soap and candle company that sold products primarily through their online store on Etsy in the year 2020. Using the sales data from the Bubblewicks Etsy store, a product analysis is performed in order to determine the best strategies for maximizing north-star metrics including total orders and total products sold.

**Goals:**
-	Decide which products should remain listed and which should be taken off the store page.
-	Find ways to increase total sales and boost ARPC.
-	Identify time periods where sales were highest and lowest.

**Results:**
Analysis concluded that some products heavily outweighed others in total sales and that these high selling products should be the main focus of the shop going forward. Other lower selling products could be removed and replaced with new products. Findings showed very few customers purchased more than one item on the store, and that strategies such as offering bundled deals could help increase ARPC.

### [CANADA JOBS ANALYSIS - DATAKIND](https://github.com/JackLemere/DataKind-Canada-Jobs-Analysis)
**Overview:** DataKind is an organization which seeks to utilize data science and AI to tackle various humanitarian issues worldwide. As a volunteer, I analyzed job data from Statistics Canada in order to find gaps in economic opportunity within certain demographics. This project was part of an overall collaboration in finding opportunities for growth in economic opportunity and financial inclusion worldwide.

**Goals:**
-	 Find, explore, and clean data related to Canada’s job market
-	 Determine if current Canadian job market trends have any negative impact on economic opportunities
-	 Seek opportunities for improving financial inclusion in Canada

**Results:** 
Main findings showed that less educated and less experienced individuals appear to be most disadvantaged by current job market trends. Current trends show that while jobs of all types have been declining in recent years, the jobs with lower education and experience requirements are declining at a much faster pace. Those seeking these types of jobs will likely see higher competition compared to previous years and may be at higher risk of reduced financial opportunity.
